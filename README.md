# Connect 4 React App

Welcome to the Connect 4 React App! This is a digital version of the classic game Connect 4, built using React. The objective of the game is to connect four of your game pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, before your opponent does.


## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

git clone https://github.com/aubreyross/Connect-4-React.git

### Change into the project directory:

cd connect-4-react

### Install the required dependencies:
npm install

### Start the development server:
npm start

Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 

## Game Rules
The game follows the standard rules of Connect 4:

Players take turns to drop their game pieces (red or black) into the grid from the top.
The pieces fall straight down, occupying the next available space within the column.
The objective is to connect four of your game pieces in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
The first player to achieve this wins the game.
If all columns are filled without anyone achieving four in a row, the game is a draw.
